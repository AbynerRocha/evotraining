## üåü About the Project

**EvoTraining** is a project created for the PAP (Professional Aptitude Test) of Escola Profissional do Infante. It is a mobile application designed to manage bodybuilding workouts.

From the start, I decided that this project should push me out of my comfort zone (which was web development), so I opted to build a mobile app. I chose React Native because of its versatility, component-based structure, and the wealth of community packages that speed up development.

When it came to choosing a database, I selected [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) because I had never used it in a project before, and its document-based structure was different from what I was used to.

During the planning stage, a question arose: *How would the exercise data be added to the database?* This was an important question, as there are countless exercises across many modalities. Initially, I planned to use an API to fetch exercise data, but all available APIs with good response time and data volume had limitations that would affect app usability, so that idea was discarded.

Another approach considered was saving API data into our database. This worked to some extent, but lacked something essential: exercise illustrations. Some APIs had them, but required tokenized requests, meaning we would need additional calls to fetch illustrations. That solution was also discarded. This led to the idea of creating a web dashboard so that the "team" could manually add exercises over time, and that became our chosen path.

Throughout the planning and development of this project, I significantly improved my skills, especially in mobile development, which was completely new to me. I believe this growth is reflected in the code, especially in terms of organization and performance. Given the tight deadline I faced, I'm really happy with the outcome.
